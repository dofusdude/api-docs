# API Documentation

This is the OpenAPI Specification for https://api.dofusdu.de.

The Swagger instance on the main page links directly to this document on GitHub.

If you find errors or want to propose features (never break backwards compatibility), you are welcome to contribute.

The original yaml was created with a GUI Tool named [Stoplight Studio](https://stoplight.io). There are many tools for working with OpenAPI, checkout https://openapi.tools for more.

For now, the Spec will stay in 3.0 until more tools support 3.1.

## Propose Features
2 Ways. One way is to just visit the [Discord](https://discord.gg/3EtHskZD8h) and write something into the chat.

The second, much more serious way:

Fork this repository. Then make the desired changes and push. GitHub will ask to if you want to create a pull request. Do that.

In the comments of the pull request we can talk about the changes.
If your feature is really complicated or you want to talk about it, visit the [Discord](https://discord.gg/3EtHskZD8h).
A feature can be discussed in the PR and will be merged as soon as it goes online.

The first way is much simpler but the chances of actually getting the feature implemented is higher because you already did the initial part of designing the API.
