# API Documentation

This is the OpenAPI Specification for the [Dofusdude API](https://docs.dofusdu.de).

The Swagger instance on the main page links directly to this document on GitHub.

If you find errors or want to propose features (never break backwards compatibility), you are welcome to contribute.

The original yaml was created with a GUI Tool named [Stoplight Studio](https://stoplight.io). There are many tools for working with OpenAPI, checkout [OpenAPI.Tools](https://openapi.tools) for more.

For now, the Spec will stay in 3.0 until more tools support 3.1.

## Propose Features

2 Ways. One way is to just visit the [Discord](https://discord.gg/3EtHskZD8h) and write something into the chat.

The second, much more serious way:

Fork this repository. Then make the desired changes and push. GitHub will ask to if you want to create a pull request. Do that.

To avoid blowing up the git history, please use the [Prettier plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) in VS Code for formatting.

In the comments of the pull request we can talk about the changes.
If your feature is really complicated or you want to talk about it, visit the [Discord](https://discord.gg/3EtHskZD8h).
A feature can be discussed in the PR and will be merged as soon as it goes online.

The first way is much simpler but the chances of actually getting the feature implemented is higher because you already did the initial part of designing the API.

## Thank you!
I highly welcome everyone on my Discord to just talk about projects and use cases or give feedback of any kind.

The servers have a fixed monthly cost to provide very fast responses. If you want to help me keeping them running or simply  donate, consider becoming a [GitHub Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/dofusdude).
